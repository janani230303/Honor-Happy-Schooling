    <h4 class="jannn">Schools are educational institutions that provide structured learning experiences for students. They can vary in size, curriculum, and teaching methodology, but their main goal is to provide a comprehensive education to students. Schools can be categorized based on the age of their students, such as preschools, elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools.<br> In addition, some schools specialize in certain areas, such as art schools, music schools, and vocational schools. The curriculum of a school typically includes core subjects such as math, science, language arts, and social studies, as well as elective courses that allow students to explore their interests and talents. In many schools, students are also required to participate in physical education classes and extracurricular activities.</h4>
